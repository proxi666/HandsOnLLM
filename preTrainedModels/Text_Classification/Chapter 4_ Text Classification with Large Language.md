# Chapter 4: Text Classification with Large Language Models

## Overview

This chapter introduces text classification as a foundational application of Large Language Models, marking the transition from theoretical understanding to practical implementation. We explore how different LLM architectures approach classification tasks and implement both fine-tuning and embedding-based solutions.

## Key Concepts Covered

### **LLM Architecture Types for Classification**

**Autoregressive Models (GPT-style)**

- Decoder-only transformer architecture optimized for text generation
- Performs classification by generating text outputs
- Excellent for few-shot learning with prompt engineering
- Mathematical foundation: p(x) = ∏p(xt|x<t)

**Autoencoding Models (BERT-style)**

- Encoder-only bidirectional transformer
- Trained using Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
- Specialized for understanding tasks like classification
- Requires fine-tuning for optimal performance

**Encoder-Decoder Models (T5-style)**

- Text-to-text unified framework
- Treats classification as sequence-to-sequence generation
- Versatile for both understanding and generation tasks


### **Classification Approaches**

**Fine-tuning Strategy**

- Task-specific adaptation of pre-trained models
- Higher accuracy potential through specialized training
- More computationally intensive but optimal for critical applications

**Embedding + Classifier Strategy**

- Uses pre-trained embeddings with simple classifiers
- Faster training and lower resource requirements
- Good balance between efficiency and performance


## Technical Implementation

### **Self-Attention Mechanism**

Understanding how models process relationships between words through:

- Query, key, and value vector transformations
- Weighted attention score calculations
- Long-range dependency capture for contextual understanding


### **Tokenization Process**

- Converting text input into numerical tokens
- Handling vocabulary limitations and out-of-vocabulary words
- Impact on model performance and output quality


## Practical Applications

### **Model Selection Framework**

- **Latency Requirements**: Choose based on inference speed needs
- **Accuracy Demands**: Balance performance vs computational cost
- **Resource Constraints**: Consider memory and compute limitations
- **Task Complexity**: Match model capability to problem difficulty


### **Evaluation Methodology**

- Implementation of confusion matrices and classification reports
- Precision, recall, and F1-score analysis
- Performance comparison across different architectures


## Code Examples

The chapter includes hands-on implementations demonstrating:

- Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification
- Using GPT models for few-shot text classification
- Embedding-based classification with traditional ML algorithms
- Evaluation and comparison of different approaches


## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding when to use representation vs generation models
- Implementing both fine-tuning and embedding-based pipelines
- Evaluating model performance using industry-standard metrics
- Making informed decisions about model selection based on requirements


## Technologies Used

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Models**: BERT, GPT variants, T5
- **Evaluation**: scikit-learn, custom metrics
- **Environment**: Google Colab with GPU support

This chapter establishes the foundation for practical LLM applications by bridging theoretical knowledge with working classification systems, preparing for more complex applications in subsequent chapters.
